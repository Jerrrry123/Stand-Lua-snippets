# Stand Lua snippets

Snippets for the Stand Lua API made for visual studio code.

# Installation

Choose if you want the version with single or double quotes, put the json file in your `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\snippets` directory and you will get some nice snippets. The json file must be names `lua.json`.

# Other

I also recommend using [StandLLS](github.com/well-in-that-case/StandLLS) for intellisense.
